# Scyfin Custom

This project is a **personal fork** of [Scyfin](https://github.com/loof2736/scyfin), a custom CSS theme for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/).  
I created this fork to add a few **personal branding tweaks and visual adjustments** â€” mainly replacing the logo and page title with my own *SLB* branding.

All credit for the original design and structure goes to **[loof2736](https://github.com/loof2736)**, creator of **Scyfin**.
